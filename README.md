# Module-1-Challenge

## Description 

### Purpose
Demonstrate how to refactor code with the aim of improving accessiblitity for users that access the website through other means, such as screen readers etc.

### What I did
- Updated html elements to ensure they have relevant semantic value, such as adding sections, articles and nav.
- Ensured html follows a logical structure
- Ensured all images have alt tags
- Updated the title to be more descriptive
- Ensured all links are functioning correctly

Additionally, ensured css was more readable by:
- adding comments
- consolidating selectors and properties
- organising the css to follow the same structure as the html
